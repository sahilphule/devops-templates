# Dev Containers
The Dev Containers lets you use a container as a full-featured development environment inside Visual Studio Code. You can open any folder inside (or mounted into) a container and take advantage of VSCode's full feature set. A devcontainer.json file in your project tells VS Code how to access (or create) a development container with a well-defined tool and runtime stack. Â 
In short, a Dev Container allows you to set up a development environment and tooling within a docker container and interact with that container via VS Code.
