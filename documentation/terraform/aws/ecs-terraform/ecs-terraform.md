# Terraform ECS Deployment

### Prerequisites
1. AWS Account with an IAM User with administrative permissions.
2. Terraform installed.

---

## Steps
1. Create the **ecs-terraform** directory.
2. Folders structure for the above-created directory:
```
ecs-terraform
│───.terraform.lock.hcl
│───locals.tf
│───main.tf
│───outputs.tf
│───providers.tf
│───terraform.tfstate
│───terraform.tfstate.backup
└───.terraform
```

> We need to only create *providers.tf*, *main.tf*, *outputs.tf*, & *locals.tf* files. Other files are generated while initiating terraform.

3. Create a *providers.tf* file inside the above-created directory.
4. Inside it, define the following:
    - terraform
      - required_providers
    - provider
      - docker
      - aws
5. Click [code](https://github.com/inflection-sahil/devops/blob/master/terraform/aws/ecs/providers.tf) for reference.
6. The definition of *providers.tf* file is complete.
7. Now, create the *main.tf* file.
8. Inside *main.tf* file, we will use the following predefined modules:
    - vpc
    - s3
    - rds
    - ecr
    - load-balancer
    - ecs
9. Also define the following s3 resource for uploading local .env file:
    - aws_s3_object
10. Click [code](https://github.com/inflection-sahil/devops/blob/master/terraform/aws/ecs/main.tf) for reference.
11. The definition of *main.tf* file is complete.
12. Now we will create *outputs.tf* file.
13. Inside it, define the following outputs.
    - DB_HOST
    - bastion-host-ip
14. Click [code](https://github.com/inflection-sahil/devops/blob/master/terraform/aws/ecs/outputs.tf) for reference.
15. The definition of *outputs.tf* file is complete.
16. Now we will create *locals.tf* file.
17. Inside it, define the following variables:
    - vpc-properties
    - s3-properties
    - database-properties
    - bastion-properties
    - load-balancer-properties
    - ecs-properties
18. Click [code](https://github.com/inflection-sahil/devops/blob/master/terraform/aws/ecs/sample-locals.txt) for reference.
19. The definition of *locals.tf* file is complete.

> Make sure you give the appropriate values to the varibles defined in *locals.tf* file.

## Provisioning the Infrastructure
Now we will provision the infrastructure by applying the above-created configuration files.

> Ensure AWS CLI is configured with appropriate AWS user credentials and enough permissions.

### Steps:
1. Open the PowerShell.
2. Change the directory to the above-created **ecs-terraform** directory using `cd` command.
3. Run the `terraform init` command to initialize the *terraform*.  
4. Run the `terraform fmt --recursive` command to format the syntax of the files.
5. Run the `terraform validate` command to validate the configuration files.
6. Run the `terraform plan` command to plan the resources to be created.
7. Run the `terraform apply` command and if prompted, type `yes` to provision the infrastructure.
8. Run the `terraform output` command to get the values of defined variables in *outputs.tf* file.
9. Head to the AWS console, and verify the created resources.
10. Then,
    - Head towards EC2 dashboard.
    - Select *Load Balancers*, and select the created load balancer.
    - Copy the DNS address.
    - Paste the address in the browser to access the application.

## Connection to the RDS database through Bastion Host using MySQL Workbench
1. Open MySQL Workbench.
2. Click Add Connection.
3. Select connection method as **Standard TCP/IP over SSH**.
4. In SSH Hostname, enter *bastion-host-ip:22* where bastion-host-ip is received from `terraform output`.
5. In SSH Username, enter *ec2-user*.
6. In SSH Key File, select *bastion-key.pem* file passed in above *locals.tf* file from your local computer.
7. In MySQL Hostname, enter *DB_HOST* where DB_HOST is received from `terraform output`.
8. In the Password section, select *Store in Vault*, and enter the password passed in above-created *locals.tf* file.
9. Click *OK* and open the connection.
10. Now you can run mysql commands to access databases, and verify the successful connection of *ecs-container*.

## Destroy the provisioned infrastructure

1. To destroy infrastructure, change directory to the above-created **ecs-terraform** directory using `cd` command.
2. Run `terraform destroy` & if prompted, type `yes`.
3. Infrastructure will be destroyed.
