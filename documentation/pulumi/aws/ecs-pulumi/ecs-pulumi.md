# ECS Provisioning using Pulumi
- We will provision the ECS using Pulumi as an Infrastructure as Code.
- We will deploy it in a custom Virtual Private Cloud for isolation.
- We will connect the Container App to ECR for Docker Image.
- We will also create S3 bucket to store the *.env* file.
- Also will deploy RDS MySQL Instance to store the relational data and connect it to ECS.

---
## Prerequisites
---

1. An AWS account with an IAM user having sufficient permissions.
2. AWS CLI installed and configured with the IAM user.
3. Pulumi Installed.

---
## Write Pulumi Configuration files
---

First, we will initiate and edit Pulumi configuration files for AWS resources using predefined Pulumi Library available on the internet.

## Steps
1. Create a Pulumi Project directory.
2. Open the PowerShell.
3. Change the directory to the above-created Pulumi Project.
4. Run the **`pulumi new aws-python`** command to initialize the *pulumi*.
5. Provide the appropriate values to prompts such as *project-name*, *project-description*, *stack-name*, *toolchain*, *region-name*, etc.
6. This will generate some Pulumi files in this directory.
7. Now we will install predefined Pulumi modules.
8. Activate the **`venv`** by running **`venv\Scripts\activate`**.
9. Run **`pip install git+https://github.com/sahilphule/pulumi.git`** to install the modules.
10. Deactivate the **`venv`** by running **`deactivate`**.
11. Now open the directory in the preferred IDE.
12. Create *commons* folder
13. Inside the folder create *__init__.py* file.
14. Import the following in the *__init__.py* file:
    - from inflection_zone_pulumi.modules.aws.vpc import vpc
    - from inflection_zone_pulumi.modules.aws.s3 import s3
    - from inflection_zone_pulumi.modules.aws.rds import rds
    - from inflection_zone_pulumi.modules.aws.load_balancer import load_balancer
    - from inflection_zone_pulumi.modules.aws.ecs import ecs
15. Click [code](https://github.com/inflection-zone/iac-recipes/blob/inflection-sahil/pulumi/aws/ecs/commons/__init__.py) for reference.
16. Definition of *__init__.py* is complete.
17. Now create the *values.py* file in the root folder of the above-created project directory.
18. Define the following values:
    - vpc_properties
    - s3_properties
    - rds_properties
    - bastion_properties
    - ecs_properties
    - ecs_container_definition
    - load_balancer_properties
19. Click [code](https://github.com/inflection-zone/iac-recipes/blob/inflection-sahil/pulumi/aws/ecs/sample.values.py) for reference.
20. The definition of *values.py* is complete.
21. Now navigate to the *__main__.py* file present in the root folder of the above-created project directory.
22. Clear the sample code if present.
23. Import the following:
    - pulumi
    - pulumi_aws as aws
    - from commons import vpc, s3, rds, load_balancer, ecs
    - values
24. Define the following objects and pass the values as an argument:
    - VPC
    - S3
    - RDS
    - Load_balancer
    - ECS
    - bucket_object
25. Click [code](https://github.com/inflection-zone/iac-recipes/blob/inflection-sahil/pulumi/aws/ecs/__main__.py) for reference.
26. Definition of *__main__.py* is complete.

## Provisioning the Infrastructure
---

Now we will provision the infrastructure by applying the above-created configuration files.
> Ensure AWS CLI is configured with appropriate IAM user credentials and enough permissions.

### Steps:
1. Open the PowerShell.
2. Change the directory to the above-created Pulumi Project.
3. Run the **`pulumi up`** command and if prompted, select **`yes`** to provision the infrastructure onto the AWS Cloud.
4. Head to the AWS Console, and verify the created resources.
5. Access the service onto the browser using the load balancer url received by running **`pulumi stack output url`**.

## Connection to the RDS database through Bastion Host using MySQL Workbench
---

Now, we will use MySQL Workbench to connect and access the MySQL RDS Database through above created Bastion Host.

1. Open MySQL Workbench.
2. Click Add Connection.
3. Select connection method as **Standard TCP/IP over SSH**.
4. In SSH Hostname, enter *bastion-host-ip:22* where bastion-host-ip is received from **`pulumi stack output bastion-host-ip`** command.
5. In SSH Username, enter *ec2-user*.
6. In SSH Key File, select *bastion-key.pem* file passed in above *values.py* file from your local computer.
7. In MySQL Hostname, enter *DB_HOST* where DB_HOST is received from **`pulumi stack output DB_HOST`**.
8. In the Password section, select *Store in Vault*, and enter the password passed in above-created *values.py* file.
9. Click *OK* and open the connection.
10. Now you can run MySQL commands to access databases and verify the successful connection of *ecs-service*.

## Destroy the provisioned infrastructure
---

Lastly, we will destroy the above-created resources.

## Steps
1. To destroy infrastructure, open the Powershell Window and change the directory to the above-created Pulumi Project using the **`cd`** command.
2. Run **`pulumi destroy`** & if prompted, select **`yes`**.
3. Infrastructure will be destroyed.
