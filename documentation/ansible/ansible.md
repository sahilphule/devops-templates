## Steps
### Define Inventory File

mkdir ~/ansible && cd ~/ansible
vim inventory
```

2. Add the following content (replace with actual server IPs):
```ini
[webservers]
192.168.1.100
192.168.1.101

[dbservers]
192.168.1.200
```

### Configure SSH Access
1. Ensure your WSL instance can connect to remote hosts via SSH by copying the SSH Private Key file inside Ubuntu in **.ssh** folder.
2. Test the connection:
```sh
ansible -i inventory -m ping all
```

### Configure Nginx on the Remote Host

  hosts: ubuntu
  become: yes
  tasks:
